# Learning Webpack + React

I am following a tutorial from http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack/

[Understanding React Components](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/implementing_notes/#understanding-react-components)

[React Component Conventions](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/implementing_notes/#react-component-conventions)

[React and Flux](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/react_and_flux/)

[Implementing a Wrapper for `localStorage`](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/react_and_flux/#implementing-a-wrapper-for-localstorage-)

  We're operating with localStorage directly to keep the implementation simple. An alternative would be to use [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) to hide all the complexity. You could even integrate it behind our interface.
